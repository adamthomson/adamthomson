<summary>Background (Click to expand)</summary>
Since 2019, I've worked for Shopify. In Enterprise Support management since 2021, and I'm very proud to help my team support some of the biggest flash sellers and household name brands in the world. 🚀 That said, I've had a varied and interesting career which I believe gives me excellent foresight and adaptability. Please take the time to read this brief summary!<br /><br />Early in my career, I worked as a clothing and graphic designer, then I was a musician/promoter/dj before being invited to run a struggling radio station with 60K monthly listeners. Tldr; we saved the station!<br /><br />Since then, I've worked in marketing and communications, website development and IT systems administration. I've helped many dozens of clients with their online presence from businesses of all size, charities and other organisations, and some government related entities.<br /><br />I'm an experienced public speaker, having spent 11y on radio, but also I was a WordPress meetup organiser. I've done talks in-person and online about WordPress, including emceeing WordCamp NZ the national conference. I'm proud of my time being a member of and contributor to that community before coming to Shopify.

I've been with Shopify since 2019, in a leadership capacity since 2021, where I'm proud to support major brands globally. My career began in graphic and web design as well as music, transitioning to managing a legendary 40yo radio station, which we revitalized successfully. I've also worked extensively in marketing, web development, and IT systems administration, serving a wide range of clients including businesses, charities, and government entities. As a public speaker and community organizer, I've contributed to various forums, including emceeing WordCamp NZ the national WordPress conference. 

I believe my diverse experiences enhance my adaptability and foresight in professional settings, making me a valuable member of any team or project.
