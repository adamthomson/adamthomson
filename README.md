<summary>Background (Click to expand)</summary>
Since 2019, I've worked for Shopify. In Enterprise Support management since 2021, and I'm very proud to help my team support some of the biggest flash sellers and household name brands in the world. 🚀 That said, I've had a varied and interesting career which I believe gives me excellent foresight and adaptability. Please take the time to read this brief summary!<br /><br />I was a musician, promoter and dj earlier in life, before being invited to run a radio station with 60K monthly listeners.<br /><br />I worked full-time in clothing and graphic design, then marketing and communications, then website development and IT systems administration. I've helped many dozens of clients with their online presence from businesses of all size, charities and other organisations, and some government related entities.<br /><br />I'm an experienced public speaker, having spent 11y on radio, but I also used to be a WordPress meetup organiser in Wellington, the capital of NZ. I've done talks in-person and online about that platform, including emceeing WordCamp NZ the national conference. I'm proud of my time being a member of and contributor to that community.<br /><br />I'm technically capable, but also a passionate advocate of seamless experience, good design, informed decision making, feedback loops, first principles and inspirational leadership.
