<summary>Background (Click to expand)</summary>
I've been with Shopify.com since 2019, predominantly in leadership roles, where I'm proud to help our teams do their best work. 🚀<br />
<br />
I started freelancing in web development and graphic design at a young age, transitioning to managing a legendary 40yo radio station in my late twenties, which I helped to revitalise. I've worked extensively in marketing, web development, and IT systems administration, serving a range of clients including businesses, charities, and government entities.<br />
<br />
Experienced public speaker and community organiser - I've spent over a decade as a radio announcer and interviewer, planned and emceed conferences and festivals, run meetup groups, and more recently held classes as one of New Zealand's very few certified chocolate tasters.<br />
<br />
I'm an experienced technical lead. I care about good design and seamless experiences, feedback and informed decision making, first principles thinking, fearless innovation, and inspirational leadership. I believe that my diverse experiences enhance my adaptability and foresight in professional settings, making me a valuable problem solver.
