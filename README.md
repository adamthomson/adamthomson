<summary>Background (Click to expand)</summary>
I've been with Shopify since 2019, in a leadership capacity since 2021, where I'm proud to help my team support some of the biggest flash sellers and household name brands in the world. 🚀<br />
<br />
My career began in graphic and web design as well as music, transitioning to managing a legendary 40yo radio station, which we revitalized successfully. I've since worked extensively in marketing, web development, and IT systems administration, serving a wide range of clients including businesses, charities, and government entities. As a public speaker and community organizer, I've contributed to various forums, including emceeing WordCamp NZ the national WordPress conference.<br />
<br />
I'm technically capable and agile trained, but I'm also a passionate advocate of design and UX, feedback and informed decision making, first principles, innovation, and inspirational leadership. I believe that I stand out because when people meet me they can tell that I genuinely care. I believe my diverse experiences enhance my adaptability and foresight in professional settings, making me a valuable member of any team or project.
